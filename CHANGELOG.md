# Changelog

All notable changes to Hotwash. The `hotwash-mcp` npm package keeps its own
version line (`mcp-v*` tags); entries here cover the whole repo.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Maintainer-health docs: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, GitHub issue templates (bug + feature), an issue
  config that disables blank issues and links the website and security
  policy, and a pull-request template with a no-PII / content-guard check.
- README rewritten lead-first around the incident-response + MCP
  differentiator, with a website link, a copyable MCP client config block,
  and the full verified `hotwash_*` tool list.
- Tag-triggered npm publish job for `hotwash-mcp` (tags `mcp-v*` / `v*`)
  with a skip-if-already-published guard and npm provenance.
- `HOTWASH_CORS_ORIGINS` env var: CORS origins are now configurable, with
  localhost-only defaults and narrowed methods/headers.
- TheHive integration: live `create_case`, `create_alert`, and
  `add_observable` SOAR actions with a structured client, Pydantic request
  schemas, and an opt-in live smoke test (`-m live`).
- Connector interface for live SOAR actions: registered connectors expose
  action schemas and dispatch through generic integration endpoints, with
  TheHive behind the contract, a new `http_webhook.post_json` connector, and
  optional action-result evidence attached to run steps.
- Wazuh connector: authenticated manager API client, agent query actions,
  active-response trigger action, mock payloads, and an opt-in live smoke
  test.
- Wazuh ingest hardening: route-aware forwarder template that serves
  multiple mappings from one integration script.
- GitHub Actions CI running the full `scripts/verify` gate.
- Web test suite: vitest coverage for the client-side markdown parser,
  wired into `scripts/verify`.
- `scripts/verify`: single verification entrypoint for all components.

### Changed
- Backend dependencies repinned (FastAPI 0.136, Pydantic 2.13, pytest 9)
  and installed via a repo venv; the verify gate prefers `.venv` python.
- Web bundle split into app + react + react-flow chunks (main chunk
  617 kB -> 321 kB).
- README quickstart, badges, roadmap prose, and Makefile targets brought
  back in line with the actual tree and ports.

### Fixed
- First-run playbook seeding no longer depends on a hardcoded OpenClaw
  workspace path; seeds ship under `api/seed_data/playbooks` and
  `HOTWASH_PLAYBOOK_SEED_DIR` overrides the source directory.
- Markdown link hrefs are sanitized before render: playbook content can no
  longer smuggle a `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:` link (stored XSS), and
  inline rendering is length-capped against a quadratic-regex tab freeze.
- Wazuh active-response can be restricted with a `HOTWASH_WAZUH_AR_COMMANDS`
  allow-list, and a partial failure (`failed_items`) is surfaced instead of
  being recorded as a successful action.
- HTTP webhook connector rejects `..`/`%2e` path traversal and fails on a
  stored credential that cannot be decrypted instead of sending unauthenticated.
- A completed/abandoned run's step status and decisions are frozen (409);
  reopening a completed step clears its stale `completed_at` in both the router
  and the replay reducer.
- Mermaid parsing: a shaped re-mention upgrades a node's label/type (a decision
  no longer stays a step), subgraph steps survive round-trip export, and a
  duplicate node id no longer creates an unreachable step that blocks 100%.
- SSRF guard closes the DNS-rebinding TOCTOU: integration fetches now
  resolve once, validate every resolved address, and connect to the
  pinned IP with the original hostname kept for Host/SNI; redirects on
  outbound integration requests are disabled.
- Generated API key and Wazuh seed secret are no longer written to logs
  at debug level; deployment docs now require `HOTWASH_API_KEY`.
- SSRF guard now blocks IPv6 private, loopback, and link-local targets.
- `case_id` values are validated and URL-encoded to block path injection.
- TheHive `status` reads the top-level version field of TheHive 5.4.
- MCP server strips draft-07 `$schema` from `tools/list` for Anthropic
  client compatibility.

### Removed
- Unused `Markdown` pin (clears the PYSEC-2026-89 advisory; nothing
  imports the package).
- Tracked runtime SQLite database (`api/data/playbooks.db`) removed from
  the repo and scrubbed from history; the API seeds itself on startup.
- Stale `web/public/index.html` duplicate.
